/1 and /2 and /3 are a mess   /4 is a little better 

/5 experimental /6 still experimental

7--showing promise
8-- yikes i think it introduced some bugs


9--- getting a lil crazy, main.rs makes html template strings now for easy debugging cuz its getting complicated


10---render_main_page_html: Generates the main page HTML with the list of posts and pagination links.
render_post_view_html: Generates the HTML for viewing a specific post along with its replies.
render_post_html: Generates the HTML for an individual post.
render_reply_html: Generates the HTML for an individual reply 
Code is agnostic (makes its own directories so run it in any directory)
latest reply brings post to top in main page, 
At this point requires intense testing to find and eliminate bugs. that will take a few days
but then after that 80+ percent of app should be done and tested.
